// This project was created for CPSC 411: Mobile App Development as a
//    final Project for the Fall 2025 semester.

// Advised by Prof. James Shen

// PickForMe is a small app that allows the user to input a number of items.
//      From the next two tabs in the app one can have the app choose a random item
//      via a wheel, or choose between two items repeatedly in a tournament style
//      bracket until only one item remains.
//      The last tab has a couple of random generator widgets: a d6, d20, d100,
//      a coin flip, and a random number generator.

// Thanks for taking a look at my project!
